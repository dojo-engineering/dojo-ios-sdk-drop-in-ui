The Dojo iOS SDK lets you build a simple and intuitive payment experience in your iOS mobile app.
Our default theme comes in both light and dark modes, right out of the box, which your users will love! What's more, you can customize the UI screens and add more elements to collect payment details.

## Requirements

iOS version **11.0** and later.

## Installation

The Dojo iOS SDK is available on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). Check out our [setup guide üîß](https://docs.dojo.tech/payments/mobile-integration/ios/ios-setup) to get started.

## Accept payments

Once you've installed and setup the Dojo iOS SDK, you can configure your app to start [accepting payments üí≥](https://docs.dojo.tech/payments/mobile-integration/ios/ios-accept-payments).

## Save card

You can provide your mobile app users with the ability to [save their card information](https://docs.dojo.tech/payments/mobile-integration/ios/accept-payments/ios-save-card) securely for future use.
The following is an example of this feature.
